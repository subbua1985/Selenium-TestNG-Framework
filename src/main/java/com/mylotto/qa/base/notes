TestNG:
-------

TDD Framework -- Test Driven Development

TestNG - Unit test framework useful for developers
Purpose of TestNG -- design test cases in a systematic way
- good html reporting
- variety of annotations
- priorities or sequence of test cases can be defined
- dependecies
- grouping
- data provider (multiple users simulation)

TestNG is open source and available in the form of JAR file (testNG.jar)
Also called as "Java unit testing framework"

install testNG in eclipse - Just follow the below link

https://testng.org/doc/download.html


Code syntax of TestNG
---------------------
Pre-Condition - starts with @Before
Test Cases  -- starts with @Test
Post Conditions  -- starts with @

Page Object Model:
-------------------

POM is not a framework, its simply a approach. We will use data driven framework (TestNG)
Every page as individual java class, java class will have all web objects 
Methods have to created

Layers
------

TestBase.java is the parent class will have global methods which can be used by the child classes in 1st layer & send layer (eg Webdriver(), maxwindow(), implicit wait(), deleteAllCookies())
config.properties - Define environment variables (eg URL, usernames, environments etc.,)
TestData.xlsx
TestUtil.java (eg Screehshots(), sendmail(), commonUtils())
Generate Reports (HTML, XML, testNG reports, extent reports)

All are defined in a package
com.qa.pages
1st Layer - Page Layer (all different pages in separate java class eg login, registration, lotto, bullseye, results) will inherit global methods from TestBase.java

com.qa.tests
2nd Layer - Test Layer (all test java class which implements page objects) using testNG framework will also inherit global methods from TestBase.java

all are under package
---------------------
com.qa.base
com.qa.pages
com.qa.tests
com.qa.config
com.qa.testdata
com.qa.util
com.qa.report


Maven
------

Maven is a build automation tool
